 <h2>Skills</h2>
 <p>I am optimistic as I have a positive attitude toward my future, hardworking and always try to do smart work as I am. I am good at problem solving as I have solved my subjective maths solution and the problem related to my life.  I have a great level of patience as well as flexible with the required situation. My creative, imaginative and innovative mind help in  graphic and web page designing using HTML,JAVA,C++,SQL,PYTHON,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. When I come to sports I like to play badminton and  boxing  which keeps me fresh and fit.
    I always  like to play with my strength but my life expose my weakness about public speaking and lack of confidence only to remind me that these will be my strength ,if I work on them
    With right mind set like monitoring my progress regularly and stand up for myself will increase my confidence. Meditation and yoga will help me to overcome with overthinking and emotion. Taking part in event will remove my nervousness of public speaking.
